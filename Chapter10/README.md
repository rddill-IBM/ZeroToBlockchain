[Return to Table of Contents](../README.pdf)

In this chapter, we will create the Finance Company view and add server-side services to support it.  This runs on HyperLedger Fabric Version 1.0. The code that we will write is managed in this chapter and all the subsequent chapters in the following folder structure:

Two new files are introduced in this chapter and two existing files are updated:

## Files used in this chapter
### Web Server Code Unique to this Chapter
 - **hlcClient.js**
   - This file is update to support the Finance Company interface on the server side

### Defining the business network
 
 - **network/permissions.acl**
   - This file is ***updated*** to allow the Finance Company to access Orders and to execute selected transactions. 
   - It determines precisely what transactions a member can execute and what assets a member can see. The basic rule is "If authority is not specifically granted in this file, then access is denied."

### Web Browser Code 
 - **z2b-financeCo.js**
   - This file contains all of the browser functional code to support the Finance Company user experience
 - **financeCo.html**
   - This contains the HTML framework for the Finance Company experience. Content for this framework is generated by the functions in the z2b-financeCo.js file
   - Text on this page is determined by the selected language (default is US English)
